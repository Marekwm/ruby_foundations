problem

Write a method that determines and returns the ASCII string value of a string that is passed in as an argument.
The ASCII string value is the sum of the ASCII values of every character in the string. 
(You may use String#ord to determine the ASCII value of a character.)

ex:
ascii_value('Four score') == 984
ascii_value('Launch School') == 1251
ascii_value('a') == 97
ascii_value('') == 0
