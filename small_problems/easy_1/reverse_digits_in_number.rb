P - Understanding the Problem:
- Goal: understand what you're being asked to do
  - Read the problem description
  - Identify expected input and output
  - Establish rules/requirements/define the boundaries of the problem
  - Ask clarifying questions
  - Take your time on this step!

E - Examples and Test Cases:
- Goal: further expand and clarify understanding about what you're being asked to do 
  - Use examples/test cases to confirm or refute assumptions made about the problem in the previous step

D - Data Structures:
- Goal: begin to think logically about the problem
  - What data structures could we use to solve this problem?
    - What does our data look like when we get it? (input)
    - What does our data look like when we return it? (output?)
    - What does our data need to look like in the intermediate steps?

A - Algorithm:
- Goal: write out steps to solve the given problem in plain English
  - A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task/objective
  - Start high level, but make sure you've thought through and have provided sufficient detail for working through the most difficult parts of the problem
  - Stay programming-language-agnostic
  - Can create substeps for different parts or separate concerns into a helper method
  - You can (and should) revisit your algorithm during the implementation stage if you need to refine your logic
  - Before moving onto implementing the algorithm, check it against a few test cases

C - Implementing a Solution in Code:
- Goal: translate the algorithm into your programming language of choice
  - Code with intent. Avoid hack and slash 
- TEST FREQUENTLY
  - Use the REPL or run your code as a file
  - When testing your code, always have an idea in place of what you're expecting
  - If you find that your algorithm doesn't work, return there FIRST if needed and THEN fix your code
  
PROBLEM
  Write a method that takes a positive integer as an argument and returns that number with its digits reversed. 
  Don't worry about arguments with leading zeros - Ruby sees those as octal numbers, which will cause confusing results.
  For similar reasons, the return value for our fourth example doesn't have any leading zeros.
  
Examples:
reversed_number(12345) == 54321
reversed_number(12213) == 31221
reversed_number(456) == 654
reversed_number(12000) == 21 # No leading zeros in return value!
reversed_number(12003) == 30021
reversed_number(1) == 1

P
INPUT: positive integer
OUTPUT: input number but reversed with no leading zeros 
RULES:
  Explicit Requirements:
  -The input is a positive integer
  -The ouput cannot contain any leading zeros
  -if the input is zero return zero 
  
D 
the use of a string to reverse the integer would be perfect in this case
'54321' then reverse the string to '12345' and convert it back to an integer

A 
convert the input integer into a string 
reverse the string representation of the string
convert the string back into an integer
return the reverse integer

=end 
def reversed_number(num)
  num.to_s.reverse.to_i 
end 

p reversed_number(12345) == 54321
p reversed_number(12213) == 31221
p reversed_number(456) == 654
p reversed_number(12000) == 21 # No leading zeros in return value!
p reversed_number(12003) == 30021
p reversed_number(1) == 1
