Build a command line calculator program that does the following:

asks for two numbers
asks for the type of operation to perform: add, subtract, multiply or divide
displays the result
Use the Kernel.gets() method to retrieve user input, and use Kernel.puts() method to display output. 
Remember that Kernel.gets() includes the newline, so you have to call chomp() to remove it: Kernel.gets().chomp().

Standard flow of calculator

input: ask user to give a number
save that input to `num1`
input: ask the user to give another number
save that input to `num2`

input: ask the user to choose what operation they would like to perform add, subtract, multiply or divide?
save that answer to `operation_choice`

perform operation 

display results
